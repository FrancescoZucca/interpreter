# Lingu:
## The lingustic language.


### Syntax
Lingu features verbose syntax, static typing, and is strongly typed.

> Every line ends with a `.`

> Every line starts with a keyword.

> Any kind of string value must be wrapped with quotes (`""`).
> This includes variable names and values.

> Lots and lots of syntactic sugar.
